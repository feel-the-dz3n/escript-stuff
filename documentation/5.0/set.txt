You can create and edit variables in ESCRIPT.

Use "set" command to see created variables.
Use "set variableName variableValue" to create/edit variables.

Example:

Create "hello" variable with text "Hello world!":

set hello Hello world!

After this, you can type "set" and you'll see that there is new variable. You can edit variables in the same way. Use DOLLAR symbol ($) to replace variables names with variables values in code. Example:

set userName Nikita
set password 123456
set someData ABCDE
echo $userName hacked!
echo Password: $password ($someData)

Result:
Nikita hacked!
Password: 123456 (ABCDE)

* if you want to use DOLLAR SYMBOL ($) just write &#dollar; and it will be replaced with $ 
Example:

echo This is dollar symbol: &#dollar;

There are default (system) variables. You can change them. Program creates them again after starting.

$result - command returned value
$splitArgs - split arguments with symbols. Default: "||"
$invintation - command line invintation. Default: "ESCRIPT> "
$inputText - ^ReadLine and ^ReadKey invintation.
$showResult - echo $result after command completion (1 or 0)
$showCommands - shows command's names when doing it. Only for scripts. (1 or 0)
$workingScriptName
$workingScriptFullName
$startTime

You can remove variables using "unset" ("RemoveVar") method.

To get date of creation or date of edition use:
VarCreated name
VarEdited name

To get all variables count use:
VarCount

To reinitialize variables list (remove all) use:
VarReinit
* not recommended to use it in scripts, this may broke in runtime
